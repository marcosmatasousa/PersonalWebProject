This is where I store my web project.

The project currently have only 2 pages:
* A page about me, containing info my experiences and interests.
* A simple, but functional, calculator
* A music page the redirects the user the user the album pages by clicking them
* A tic-tac-toe page game (Game draw: to be fixed).

To run the project, run flaskserver.py and access localhost:5000 on your browser.

Thank you very much.
