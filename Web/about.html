    <h1>Hello, it's nice to have you here</h1>

    <p>I am Marcos, 23 years old and a computer science student at UNICAMP (Universidade Estadual de Campinas), currently in the last year of the course.
        Due to the Computer Science course, my main knowledge currently focus on back-end algorithms and my main programming language is Python.
    </p>
    <p>The main reason I chose to course Computer Science was my passion for video games and consequently the curiosity for fixing computers (when they would crash). In the first semester of the course, I find out that my main inspiration in programming was to resolve problems through computers. </p>

    <h2>What I am currently doing</h2>
    <p>Currently I'm studying Economics for Engineering and Introduction to IA in the university. Due to being on the final of the course I just have these two disciplines for this semester.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I'm looking to learn more about Flask and Django (Python libs), HTML and JavaScript, besides RESTful application concepts. I believe this to be very import in the context of web development and currently have special interest on these topics.</p>
